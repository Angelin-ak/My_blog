Emerging in the early 20th century with its first feature film, Vigathakumaran (1928), the industry has evolved from silent films to modern digital cinema. The golden era of Malayalam cinema in the 1970s and 1980s saw filmmakers like G. Aravindan and Adoor Gopalakrishnan pushing boundaries with character-driven narratives that explored complex social issues. Iconic actors such as Mohanlal and Mammootty emerged during this time, solidifying their status as legends in the industry.
